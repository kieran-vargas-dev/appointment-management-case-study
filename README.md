# appointment-management-case-study

This is going to be a tool that allows flexible and intuitive scheduling and rescheduling of patient appointments, designed
to minimize the time and effort required to adapt to unforeseen circumstances by doctor and patient alike, incurring no cost
to the patient. All patients will be presented with a calender displaying their doctor's schedule updated in real-time, and
should the need arise will be able to shift their appointment to any of the doctor's available time-slots. Doctors will be presented
with a calender that is up to date with the patients that are scheduled for each appointment's time block.
